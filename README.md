# API Project: CountriesFacts (Capstone 2)

## Introduction

### About the requirements

> This is the repo for the second capstone project in our Microverse journey. It is a group project created by [Kingjosh007](https://github.com/Kingjosh007) and [Fikerte-T](https://github.com/Fikerte-T). 

We had to combine all the knowledge we gained in the Javascript module in order to build this project in 3-4 days. The project had be API-based and some of the requirements we had to meet included: 

- Building a single page app using Vanilla Javascript only;
- Handling API calls;
- Writing asynchronous code: make a good use of callbacks, promises and `async/await`;
- Using Webpack to bundle the app;
- Making use of the best practices and tools regarding testing: performing unit tests, following the AAA pattern, using the Jest framework;
- Using the best practices for code versioning by following Gitflow;
- Being able to organize a group work on a Kanban board (Github Projects);
- Performing code reviews for team members;
- Solving git conflicts.
- etc.


### More about the project

We chose to build our project around [a countries API](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/1134062/T1LJjU52#intro).
It's a single page app called **CountriesFacts** as it allows users to comment facts about countries.

As a user:

- I can see all the countries provided by the API when the app loads. I can see the flags, and number of likes of every country;
- I can click a like button for each country;
- Inside a popup, I can view all the comments posted by different users that pertain to a single country;
- I can post new comments for the country displayed in the popup;
- **[BONUS]** I can filter all the countries thanks to the input provided;
- **[BONUS]** I can sort all the countries based on the name or the number of likes;
- **[BONUS]** I can have the countries displayed with a pagination system for a easier navigation;
- **[BONUS]** I can set the number of countries I want to see at most per page;
