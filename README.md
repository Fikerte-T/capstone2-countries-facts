## Introduction

### About the requirements

> This is the repo for the second capstone project in our Microverse journey. It is a group project created by [Kingjosh007][https://github.com/Kingjosh007] and [Fikerte-T][https://github.com/Fikerte-T]. 

We had to combine all the knowledge we gained in the Javascript module in order to build this project in 3-4 days. The project had be API-based and some of the requirements we had to meet included: 

- Building a single page app using Vanilla Javascript only;
- Handling API calls;
- Writing asynchronous code: make a good use of callbacks, promises and `async/await`;
- Using Webpack to bundle the app;
- Making use of the best practices and tools regarding testing: performing unit tests, following the AAA pattern, using the Jest framework;

- Being able to organize a group work on a Kanban board (Github Projects);
- Performing code reviews for team members;
- Solve git conflicts.
